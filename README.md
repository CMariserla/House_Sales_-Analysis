# House_Sales_Analysis
Replication of Mo Chen's King County House Sales Analysis through Tableau!

## Data Preparation & Cleaning
The date fields were converted from text format to the proper date data type to ensure accurate time-series analysis. Fields were carefully formatted, and any anomalies in the date data were addressed to guarantee smooth filtering and visualization.

## Line Chart Creation
A line chart was created to plot the daily average house sales prices, ensuring the data was accurately aggregated by date. The color scheme was customized to purple for visual consistency, and gridlines and reference lines were removed to keep the chart clean, allowing the trend to be the main focus.

## Map Visualization
A map was designed to geocode house prices by zip code, enabling a spatial display of average prices. The color schemes were adjusted to maintain clarity and accessibility, with color gradients that represented varying price ranges.

## Histogram Creation (Price Distribution)
A histogram was developed to display the distribution of house prices, with careful adjustment to bin sizes and color palettes for consistency. This visual helped to communicate the price distribution within the dataset, with clear, easy-to-read labels.

## Histogram Creation (Bedrooms Distribution)
A second histogram was created to show the distribution of the number of bedrooms in the houses. The same formatting approach used in the price distribution was applied, maintaining visual coherence across the visuals, allowing for easy comparison of data points.

## Histogram Creation (Bathrooms Distribution)
Similar to the previous histograms, a third histogram was created to display the number of bathrooms in the dataset. Consistency in color scheme and formatting was maintained across all visuals, ensuring a smooth and unified visual flow.

## Heatmap Design
A heatmap was designed to represent the relationship between house condition and view, using color gradients to indicate average prices. Axes were carefully adjusted for logical ordering, with clear labels to highlight trends and correlations between these two variables.

## Calendar Widget
A calendar widget was added to show daily average prices, allowing users to filter by month and year. Custom color scales were used to reflect price variations for each day, providing a clear representation of price fluctuations over time.

## Dashboard Assembly
All visuals were combined into a cohesive dashboard, with a dedicated filter section and intuitive layout for easy navigation. Multiple filters were incorporated into the dashboard, including year built, square foot living, and square foot lot. These filters were organized in an intuitive layout, enabling users to narrow the data based on specific criteria. Integration with the calendar widget ensured that users could explore various time periods and property characteristics easily.
Titles, background colors, and divider lines were customized to create a professional and visually appealing dashboard that was easy for users to interact with and interpret.
